Drench is a lightweight BitTorrent client written in Python. There are a couple of nice features, like the ability to download a subset of all the files in the torrent and exiting cleanly once the download is complete. Ultimately, the plan is to incorporate a JavaScript-based visualization to let the user see what's going on while the program runs.

The preferred way to install drench is with [`pip`](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html) --- once you have it installed, just run the following command from the terminal:

`pip install drench`
